#Problem Statement: -
'''
    A certain organization wants an early estimate of their employee churn out rate. 
    So the HR department gathered the data regarding the employeeâ€™s salary hike and
    the churn out rate in a financial year. The analytics team will have to perform
    an analysis and predict an estimate of employee churn based on the salary hike. 
    Build a Simple Linear Regression model with churn out rate as the target variable. 
    Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient 
    values for different models.

#Business Problem:
'''
    The objective is to predict the employee churn out rate based on the salary 
    hike.

#Data Dictionary:
'''
    Salary_hike	Integer	Predictor variable
    Churn_out_rate	Integer	Target variable
