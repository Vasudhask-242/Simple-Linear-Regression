#Probelm Statement
'''
    A certain food-based company conducted a survey with the help of a fitness company 
    to find the relationship between a personâ€™s weight gain and the number of calories 
    they consumed in order to come up with diet plans for these individuals. 
    Build a Simple Linear Regression model with 
    calories consumed as the target variable. 
    Apply necessary transformations and record the RMSE and correlation coefficient 
    values for different models. 
'''

#Business Objective:
'''
    The objective is to find the relationship between a person's weight gain and 
    the number of calories they consumed to develop effective diet plans.
'''
#Data Dictionary:
'''    
    Weight gained (grams) =>	Integer	Target variable
    Calories Consumed	=> Integer	Predictor variable
